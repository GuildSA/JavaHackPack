##Install the Java Development Kit

For IntelliJ to compile and run Java code, you'll also need to download and install a JDK or Java Development Kit. You can download one from [Oracle's website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). The link below will go straight to the JDK version that was used to write the samples found here. It has the name ["Java SE Development Kit 8u91"](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html):

For a Mac, there is only one choice called "Mac OS X", If you're on a Windows machine, you'll need to download either the one for "Windows x86" or "Windows x64" depending your machine's hardware. If you're not certain if your machine is 32-Bit (i.e x86) or 64-Bit (i.e x64), you can use the link below to [find out](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit):
