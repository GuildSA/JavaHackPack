##Install the Java Development Kit

For IntelliJ to compile and run Java code, you'll also need to download and install a JDK or Java Development Kit. You can download one from Oracle's website here:

This link goes straight to the JDK version that was used to write the samples found here.

For a Mac, there is only one choice called "Mac OS X", If you're on a Windows machine, you'll need to download either the one for "Windows x86" or "Windows x64" depending your machine's hardware. If you're not certain if your machine is 32-Bit (i.e x86) or 64-Bit (i.e x64), you can use the link below to find out:
