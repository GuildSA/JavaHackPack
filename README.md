# java-hack-pack
The java-hack-pack is a collection of Intellij projects aimed at teaching the basics of the Java programming language.

This is a free educational resource developed by [The Guild of Software Architects](https://guildsa.org/).

If you're not familiar with GitHub, which is the website where this code is being hosted online, simply click on the "Download ZIP" button to get all the source code and learning materials. It can be found on the far right-hand side of this page.

##Setup Video

All of the setup instructions below can be seen as a Youtube video on the [The Guild of Software Architects official Youtube channel](https://youtu.be/zJVrfMQwfRs)

##Install the IntelliJ Code Editor

To load and run these Java samples please download the [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

The link below is good for [learning the basics of IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/discover-intellij-idea.html) and making sure your setup is working correctly:

##Install the Java Development Kit

For IntelliJ to compile and run Java code, you'll also need to download and install a JDK or Java Development Kit. You can download one from [Oracle's website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). The link below will go straight to the JDK version that was used to write the samples found here. It has the name ["Java SE Development Kit 8u112"](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html):

For a Mac, there is only one choice called "Mac OS X", If you're on a Windows machine, you'll need to download either the one for "Windows x86" or "Windows x64" depending your machine's hardware. Most computers and laptops today are 64-Bit, but if you're not certain if your machine is 32-Bit (i.e x86) or 64-Bit (i.e x64), you can use the link below to [find out](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit):

##Test your setup

Once you've installed IntelliJ and the Java Development Kit, test your setup by attempting to open one of the sample projects such as "java_1_variables".

These are the menu entries that are most important:

```
Build -> Make Project
Run -> Run 'Main'
```
